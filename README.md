### What I learned

This project teached me a lot: I had to learn new js functions such as map and reduce, how to better organize my store with modules, how to create and export js files so I can reuse them in other components, how to use router-view transitions, how to work with pagination & carousel components and how to better work with promises.

### Continued development

While working in this project I realized that promises can be confusing, so I want to create another project with APIs to get used to it.
